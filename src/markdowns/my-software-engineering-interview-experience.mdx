As we approach the end of the year, 2023 is probably the worst year in terms of snagging a software engineering job in tech, especially for fresh grads, if you look at r/cscareerquestions or r/csmajors, you'd see a bunch of doomposting that they're unable to secure job offers even way after they've graduated, keep in mind that these are people with freshly minted Computer Science bachelor's degree.

In this blog post, I will share how I managed to secure four offers as a Backend/Full-stack Engineer in the middle of this ill-starred year despite not having a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a traditional CS background.

## How It Started

In my previous post, I talked about being laid off from my first full-time position due to company restructuring, which led to the entire operations in Singapore being shut down, which means that I had to frantically look for a job within a month (which is the notice period).

Unfortunately, I do not have a Sankey chart because I did not keep track of my job applications back then, but based on the email count that I searched back that notified me of successful submission of a job application, I estimate it to be around 100+ from LinkedIn Easy Apply and 200+ from MyCareersFuture, which is a Singapore job portal platform for Singaporeans. Totaling up with some other manual submissions on the company's career site, I'd estimate that I've spammed out a good ~500 job applications over one and a half months.

To manage expectations and not get anyone's hopium up, please understand that while I do not have formal qualifications in tech, the roles I applied for were mid-level experienced to senior roles, which are **considerably easier** to secure interviews/offers for as compared to fresh grad entry-level roles, getting a foot into the industry is still a huge bottleneck, which is the root problem plaguing tech and fresh grads in 2023.

## Preparation

For an experienced role, there are multiple facets to preparing for a software engineer interview, they are as follows:

- Data Structures & Algorithms (a la leetcode interview)
- System Design (your understanding of technologies, and theoretical concept of real-world application in software engineering)
- Projects (Personal or otherwise)
- Your previous work experience
- Soft skills
- Take-home assignments

### Data Structures & Algorithms

Even after working for a couple of years, DSA is still asked rather frequently as a sanity check or low-hanging fruit for interviewers to screen a candidate. You might think, I've been working for so many years, how the hell would I even remember how I would invert a binary tree, reverse a linked list, or even implement DFS BFS?

The hard truth is, to a certain extent, you should be practicing for it, maybe once in a while even if you have a
secure job. These are concepts you have (and should) learned before and should be second nature when revising or refreshing your understanding of the concept, and personally speaking, I believe that these are the foundational building blocks of your career as a software engineer.

Not only that, but understanding it means that you should be able to explain these concepts to a layman, in my case, rubber duck programming while practicing helped a lot, especially since we're expected to communicate our thought process to the interviewers, so these verbal communication skills are very important. In my opinion, you don't have to solve the questions posed to you during the interview perfectly, but you **definitely have to be able** to articulate your thought process and throw out clarifications based on your critical thinking skills.

### System Design

For an experienced candidate, these should be second nature to you, simply because you are exposed to them as part of your job scope in your daily engineering life. Questions like Why do you index your database?, Why paginate data, or What are the pros and cons between monolith and microservices? are low-hanging fruits that you should be able to grasp.

You need to be able to ask yourself if you have learned anything from your experience, be it building your own projects, or at work.

Being able to tie real-world requirements for your theoretical product and coming up with an appropriate solution (i.e. don't do premature optimization) is an important instinct to have.

For example, if we're building an application for AI and machine learning projects, say scraping through the internet, we will be getting a vast amount of diverse data that will be collected and processed, or if we have a CMS (Content Management System) content that frequently changes, then we can infer that an appropriate database stack for this application would be NoSQL, so something like MongoDB or some sort.

### Projects and Previous Work Experience

My personal belief is that you should have a couple of projects that you can talk about, be they work or personal, and highlight you as a software engineer, this is because you're building stuff, and there should be **some form of ownership** over the projects you're involved in, even if you're not leading it. Being able to take ownership in my opinion is very important.

For example, I enjoy building random stuff, projects that plug the gap that I see in my daily life, a proxy solution for my home server because of the inconvenience I was facing, or even this blog because I wanted full control over the API functionalities and cute design I envisioned.

You should also be able to articulate what you've done at work in your previous jobs in details, personally, if you have interest in your job and tech in general, you should be fine in this aspect!


### Soft Skills

Believe it or not, as a software engineer, soft skills such as communication, collaboration and just having EQ, in general, make up at least half the job responsibility.

For example, if you don't know something, it is okay to say that I don't know. In many of my interviews that I've gotten an offer for, I did not clear it perfectly, perfect as in being able to answer every single question flawlessly, if I didn't know, I would just straight up say I don't know, or I don't have experience in that aspect.

Showing genuine interest to learn and being inquisitive in general is also important, what the interviewers are looking for isn't a ready-made requirement, but the potential they see in you, this was expressed to me explicitly in many interviews where I showed genuine interest in, and I'd be more likely to hire someone that shows interest in the topics we're talking about rather than someone yapping monotonously about technical stuff flawlessly if I were in their place.

If you can't express that in your interview, believe me, the interviewers will be able to tell if you're trying to bullshit or if you're not acting like yourself!


### What I've experienced in actual interviews

There were quite a lot of things:

- System Design (Payment service designs and idempotency, URL shortener, Rest APIs, microservice communication and queues, user feedback on long running tasks)
- DevOps Knowledge (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, AWS)
- Leetcode easy to mediums
- Take-home assignments (Building typical full-stack web applications, deployed with Docker)
- Random computer science trivia questions (spacetime complexity, data structures and algorithms)
- In-depth technical discussion on my previous work experience (You usually have to defend your decisions, or articulate why this or that is happening and the pros & cons in retrospect)

Typically, each company interviews around 3-5 rounds (1 screening, 2 technical, 1 HM/HR call, 1 behavioral, etc.), with most of them between 4-5 rounds. The shortest I've had was 1 technical round.

### What I've learned

Getting rejected is fine, in my previous blog post, I mentioned that I was completely schooled for my Squarepoint interview because I could not answer many computer science-based and software engineering design questions, which in retrospect, was absolutely ridiculous that I did not know.

Screwing up these interviews is good, it means that you are made aware of your knowledge gap, which is extremely important because you need to have an understanding of a direction to head towards to rapidly improve in. I'm super glad that I failed horribly in that first interview because it formed the foundational blocks that allowed me to quickly improve and ace other subsequent interviews in a matters of months.

As I've mentioned earlier, it is okay to say that you don't know, there is no shame in not knowing what you don't know, in fact, in our trade and industry, we are constantly learning every day. Don't believe me? You can pick someone super experienced in a big company or whatever that you absolutely look up to, and ask them if they're learning something new every time even right now, 99.9% of the answer would be a resounding yes!

Finally, having interest is extremely important, this seemingly basic but genuine quality will get you really far as long as you possess it.
