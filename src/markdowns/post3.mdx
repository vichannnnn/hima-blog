## Adding images

The syntax shown below assumes a file called *logo.png* will be rendered by a Next.js app with the file in question stored in the `public/images` folder.

![example image](/public/images/logo.png)

## Links

Links are also structured using a combination of square brackets and parentheses. The square brackets hold the text that will appear in the document; the path to the linked resource goes between the parentheses.
