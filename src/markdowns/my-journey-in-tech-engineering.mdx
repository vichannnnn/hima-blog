Today, I wanted to ramble about my journey thus far in tech & engineering, on both my personal journey and professional journey.

&nbsp;

### Background

----

I started programming about 5 years ago, circa 2018 when I was still working as a game developer (I was not doing technical game engineering work), I recall that I was playing around with spreadsheets and calculators a lot, and I started going full 'script kiddie' on simple CLI apps and Discord bots after touching a couple of tutorials on Codecademy.

Fast forward one year, when COVID hit, despite only a year into learning programming (see: script kiddie), I decided to start freelancing online to make scripts and simple apps for clients worldwide, it was a leap of faith that somehow luckily worked out. I was learning from the pressure of doing it professionally and also getting a steady stream of income as well as a bunch of clients (even from Konami, somehow!), and that lasted throughout the entire COVID period (2020-2022) where we were pretty much stuck at home.

### The job search and interviewing journey

----

When COVID ended, I wanted to switch up in terms of lifestyle as well because the freelancing hype was dying down, and I also wanted to progress into something more stable and solid, so I started looking for my first full-time job, it was also an official journey into actually adulting because I didn't know anything about resume, job applications, technical interview, or even what to expect at a full-time job.

I remember making a really bad resume with colors, multi-columns, and shit because I didn't know better, and one of my friends who found out that I was looking for my first job offered to vet my resume for me, and she schooled me hard on it subsequently (thanks Vic, I really learned a lot from that!).

Surprisingly, it turned out that I had quite a lot to write into my resume that wasn't fluff, I was honestly worried about that because I am always hearing from people around me that they have nothing to write.

The job search lasted for a little less than a month, I started applying at the start of July, and during the entire month, I had interviews from two companies, one with Squarepoint and one with Yoozoo a week after.

Without knowing what to expect from any technical interviews, I passed the HR screen but got schooled really hard during the second round technical interview with Squarepoint because I couldn't answer a single question that they posed and was stammering hard, I'm pretty sure this does not happen 99% of the time (based on my experience up till now and from everyone I know), but you don't screw up technicals so hard that the interviewer directly tells you that they can't proceed you right during the interview itself.

On the bright side, the engineer interviewing me was really patient and nice, and he offered to take the remaining time to answer my queries on the knowledge gap that I wanted to identify and cover, he even gave me his email if I ever have any questions in the future that needs his help!

To the interviewer: I don't know if you will ever get to see this, but I just wanted to say that because of that interview experience itself, I was extremely ~~traumatized~~ motivated, and learned a lot, whether it be identifying my knowledge gap, directions that I should pursue, or just experience in general, you single-handedly gave me the opportunity that allowed me to cover, experience and learn everything in under a year that most people took for their entire bachelor's degree or even longer. (Thanks G, you're the G fr)

After that, I was given a take-home assignment by Yoozoo that I cleared perfectly, and the technical on-site was just a series of follow up from the take-home which I had no issue elaborating on as well as talking about my previous experience as a freelancer.

### Leapfrogging into a full-time Senior Backend Engineer at Yoozoo

----

Within a month of job searching, I received an offer for the Senior Backend Engineer role where I will be working on backend engineering with R&D and AI products.

Frankly speaking, I couldn't believe it (and I still think back about this from time to time) as it was my first real full-time job, and it was already a senior one, which was a completely unconventional path, most people start off as a junior/associate as a fresh graduate, and then they slowly climb up the ladder, and for those who know me personally, you'd know that I don't have a bachelor's degree but only A Levels, which is just crazy!

To be fair to myself, it may be because they knew and saw that I had experience in the full software development lifecycle and I was also taking on roles that required requirements capturing, even doubling as a product manager myself since I was working alone as a freelance.

With that said, it was a short but really interesting 9 months of experience because I got to work on a greenfield project where I was in charge of all the facets of the project, from requirements capturing, product management, handling DevOps to interviewing interns and mentoring them and I was catching up and learning what people learn in years within months... until we got laid off during March.

### Round 2 of job search & interviewing

----

Funny enough, the day the layoff was announced was my birthday, what a big birthday gift. This time, the job search lasted for about 2 months, from early March to the end of April, with more experience interviewing as well as job experience, the interview experience was significantly easier, and I yielded much better results overall, securing 4 offers over 2 months, landing me my current job which I really enjoy working at!

I will be talking more about software engineer interview experience and what to expect overall in another blog post~
